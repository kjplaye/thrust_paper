\abstract{We present a framework that connects the Unruh effect to localized excitations produced by a bilocal driving source. Using modular automorphisms, we track mode and observer localization across nested Rindler wedges and construct compact wave-packet approximations with parabolic cylinder functions. This provides a smooth interpolation from global Rindler modes to fully localized excitations, showing how vacuum correlations can appear as directed, source-driven responses within the field.}

\section{Introduction}
The Unruh effect\cite{unruh1976notes} shows how uniformly accelerated observers perceive the Minkowski vacuum as a thermal bath of particles. In this work, we develop a complementary viewpoint by examining, a source-based construction, in which excitations can arise from localized entangled emissions that drive the field.


In Section \ref{sec:prelim}, we review the Unruh effect, including the relevant mode expansions and Bogoliubov transformations. In Section \ref{sec:drive}, we construct a bilocal source term, motivated by squeezed-state interactions in quantum optics, that injects correlated excitations into the field. Section \ref{sec:loc} explores partial localization by considering sub-regions of the Rindler wedge related through space-like translations and reflections, transformations that correspond to modular automorphisms in the associated operator algebras. We then use parabolic cylinder functions to construct a smooth interpolation between eternal Rindler modes and fully localized modes. Finally, in Sections \ref{sec:future} and \ref{sec:conc}, we recommend future research and interpret the implications of our construction.

These results show how localized excitations can provide microstates consistent with the thermal Unruh ensemble.

\section{Preliminaries} \label{sec:prelim}

We draw notation and standard results from Frodden and Vald{\'{e}}s \cite{frodden2018unruh}. Let $\hbar$ = $c$ = 1. We follow the standard practice of working in 1+1 dimensional Minkowski spacetime with free, massless scalar fields, which isolates the essential features of the Unruh effect without the technical overhead of higher dimensions or interactions. These simplifications do not alter the key physics in this paper, but make the structure of mode localization transparent.

Consider the free scalar massless Lagrangian
\begin{equation}
\mathscr{L}_{free} = -\frac{1}{2} \eta^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu \phi \partial_\nu \phi.
\end{equation}
We consider positive frequency modes with dispersion relation $\omega_k = |k| > 0$ as solutions to the resulting Klein-Gordon equation 

\begin{equation}
  \Box \phi = -\frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial t^2} + \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial x^2} = 0,
 \label{massless-wave-eq}
\end{equation}
where $\Box = \eta^{\mu\nu} \partial_\mu \partial_\nu$. We expand $\phi$ in terms of ladder operators $a_k, a_k^\dagger$

\begin{equation}
  \phi(x,t) = \int \diff k \, a_k \varphi_k(x,t) + \text{h.c.}
\end{equation}
where

\begin{equation}
  \varphi_k(x,t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{4\pi\omega_k}} e^{i(kx - \omega_k t)}.
\label{amode}
\end{equation}
are pure Minkowkski positive frequency waves normalized with respect to the Klein-Gordon inner product over a Cauchy surface $\Sigma$ (usually $t = 0$)
\begin{equation}
  \left<f, g\right>_{KG} = i \int_\Sigma \diff x (f^* \partial_t g - \partial_t f^* g).
\end{equation}

\subsection{Rindler Coordinates} 

To describe the physics from the point of view of a uniformly accelerating observer, we introduce Rindler coordinates \cite{frodden2018unruh,rindler1966kruskal} covering a right wedge 
\begin{equation}
  W = \{(x,t) : x>|t|\}
\end{equation}
with apex at the origin, pictured\footnote{All diagrams follow the convention of $t$ increasing upward and $x$ increasing to the right.} in Figure \ref{rindlerw}; with coordinates
\begin{equation}
  t = \frac{1}{a}e^{a\xi}\sinh{(a\eta)}
\label{sinh}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
x = \frac{1}{a}e^{a\xi}\cosh{(a\eta)}
\end{equation}
The constant acceleration parameter $a$ is introduced explicitly to make the dependence on the Unruh temperature, $T = \frac{a}{2\pi}$, manifest in subsequent expressions. The coordinates ($\eta$, $\xi$) describe the time and position in the frame of a uniformly accelerating observer, with world-lines of constant $\xi$ corresponding to hyperbolic trajectories in Minkowski spacetime.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{rindler_w.png}
\caption{Rindler wedge $W$ on the right, with Rindler coordinates.}
\label{rindlerw}
\end{figure}

The massless Klein-Gordon equation in Rindler coordinates is
\begin{equation}
  \Box \phi = e^{-2a \xi}(-\partial_\eta^2 + \partial_\xi^2) \phi = 0
\end{equation}
The wave equation retains the same structure as the Minkowski case, up to the overall conformal factor $e^{-2a\xi}$. Since this factor does not affect the null structure of the equation, the mode solutions retain the same plane wave form but in the Rindler coordinates
\begin{equation}
 r_k(\eta,\xi) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{4 \pi \omega_k}} e^{-i(\omega_k \eta -k \xi)} + \text{h.c.}
\end{equation}
for each wave number $k$ and positive frequency $\omega_k = |k| > 0$.  These ``Rindler modes'' are in terms of $\eta$ and $\xi$ and are thus confined to the Rindler wedge $W$.  Since Rindler coordinates only cover $W$ (the right wedge), these modes are not defined globally in Minkowski space.

\subsection{Unruh Modes}
To review how a uniformly accelerated observer perceives the Minkowski vacuum as a thermal bath, we construct the Unruh modes\cite{unruh1976notes}, analytic continuations of Rindler modes that are positive-frequency solutions with respect to Minkowski time\footnote{Positive frequency means that the modes contain no negative frequency Minkowski components.}. From now on let $\omega_k = k > 0$.

We define constants $\alpha_k$ and $\beta_k$, directly tied the the thermal description, which satisfy $\alpha_k^2 - \beta_k^2 = 1$
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \alpha_k &= \frac{e^{\frac{\pi\omega_k}{2a}}}{\sqrt{2 \sinh \frac{\pi \omega_k}{a}}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{1 - e^{-2\pi\omega_k / a}}} = \cosh \theta_k \\
    \beta_k &= \frac{e^{\frac{-\pi\omega_k}{2a}}}{\sqrt{2 \sinh \frac{\pi \omega_k}{a}}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{e^{2\pi\omega_k / a} - 1}} = \sinh \theta_k \quad \text{(thermal form)} \\
  \end{aligned}
  \label{alpha_beta}
\end{equation}
where $\theta_k$ is defined so that $\tanh{\theta_k} = \frac{\beta_k}{\alpha_k} = e^{-\pi\omega_k / a}$. These show up throughout in mode normalizations\footnote{The normalizations come from computing the Klein Gordon inner product on Minkowski space and comparing it to inner products on $W$ and $\widetilde{W}$.}, inner products, and resulting Bogoliubov transforms. $\beta_k$ also describes particle creation in terms of $|\beta_k|^2$ which has a thermal character, matching a Planck distribution at temperature $T = \frac{a}{2\pi}$.

Let $\widetilde{W}$ be the left Rindler wedge\footnote{Coordinates on this wedge are $t = -\frac{1}{a}e^{a\delta} \sinh(a\gamma)$, $x = -\frac{1}{a}e^{a\delta} \cosh(a\gamma)$; and $l_{\pm k} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{4 \pi \omega_k}} e^{i\omega_k(\gamma \pm \delta)}$.}, $x < -|t|$ with Rindler modes $l_{\pm k}$.  We analytically continue\footnote{From the definitions and properties of $\sinh$ and $\cosh$, it follows that $a(\pm t + x) = e^{a(\pm \eta + \xi)}$ and then $r_{\pm k} = e^{\pm \frac{i \omega_k}{a}\log a(\mp t + x \pm i\epsilon)}$ see \cite{frodden2018unruh} for details.  Similar statements hold for the left wedge.} the Rindler modes $r_k$, $r_{-k}$, $l_k$ and $l_{-k}$ into the $(t,x)$ plane, these are the Unruh modes
\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{ll}
    \mu^R_{\pm k} = \frac{\alpha_k }{\sqrt{4 \pi \omega_k}} (a(\mp t + x \pm  i \epsilon))^{\pm \frac{i \omega_k}{a}} & \hspace{20pt}
       {\mu^R_{\pm k}}_{|_W} \rightarrow \alpha_k r_{\pm k} \\
    \mu^L_{\pm k} =  \frac{\alpha_k}{\sqrt{4 \pi \omega_k}} (a(\mp t - x \pm  i \epsilon))^{\pm \frac{i \omega_k}{a}} & \hspace{20pt}
    {\mu^L_{\pm k}}_{|_{\widetilde{W}}} \rightarrow \alpha_k l_{\pm k} \\
  \end{array}
  \label{rindler_mode_def}
\end{equation}
We added an $i \epsilon$ prescription to dictate which branch of the log to take so that the modes are analytic and bounded on the $\mathfrak{I}(t) < 0$ half plane.  This makes the modes positive-frequency with respect to $t$.  Another way of writing the Unruh modes is
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
  \mu^R_{\pm k} &= \alpha_k r_{\pm k} + \beta_k l^*_{\mp k} \\
  \mu^L_{\pm k} &= \alpha_k l_{\pm k} + \beta_k r^*_{\mp k} \\
\end{aligned}
\label{unruh_mode_def}
\end{equation}
where the right and left modes ($r_{\pm k}$ and $l_{\pm k}$) are understood to be zero outside of their respective wedges. See Figure \ref{unruh_rainbow} for an illustration of the various modes. The magnitude shown jumps across the branch cut and conjugates the phase.  Also, note that we have ``twice as many'' Unruh modes as we have Rindler modes; we double count each $r_k$ with two analytic extensions $\mu^R_k$ and $\mu^{L*}_{-k}$, and similarly for the left modes.

The Unruh modes form an alternative orthonormal basis of solutions to the Klein-Gordon equation, distinct from the plane waves $\varphi_{\pm k}$ see the original source Unruh\cite{unruh1976notes}. The Unruh modes diagonalize (we will see in equation (\ref{diag})) the Minkowski vacuum in terms of Rindler particle states and thus provide the natural framework for describing the Unruh effect and the thermal response perceived by uniformly accelerated observers.

Color encodes the phase; brightness indicates magnitude. The Unruh modes change magnitude and conjugate phase across the log branch due to the interpretation of $\log(-1 \pm i\epsilon)$.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Bogoliubov Transforms}
We generalize the wedge $W$ to a translated wedge $W_c$ with apex $(0,c)$
\begin{equation}
 W_c = \{(t,x) : x - c > |t|\} 
\end{equation}
and a reflected (left) wedge $\widetilde{W}_c$ with apex $(0,c)$
\begin{equation}
 \widetilde{W}_c = \{(t,x) : x - c < -|t|\}.
\end{equation}
Let the superscripts $(0)$, $(c)$, $(\widetilde{c})$, and $(M)$ represent the $W_0$, $W_c$, $\widetilde{W}_c$, and Minkowski frames of reference respectively.  Let $(A \rightarrow B)$ represent an open set inclusion\footnote{In the algebraic formulation of QFT, spacetime regions correspond to operator algebras. Here, we adopt a complementary (though formally contravariant) perspective, whereby shifts in the wedge induce Bogoliubov transformations between operator algebras.} $A \subseteq B$.

This allows us to directly compute $W_0 \rightarrow M$ Bogoliubov coefficients from equation (\ref{unruh_mode_def}) for a change of basis from $a^{(M)}_q$ to $c^R_q$ and $c^L_q$
\begin{equation}
  \phi = \int \dv{q} \mu_q^R c_q^R + \mu_q^L c_q^L + \text{h.c.}
  \label{c_ladder}
\end{equation}
We find a 4 by 4 block matrix with blocks of the form
\begin{equation}
  \left[ \begin{array}{l}
      a^{(0)}_k \vspace{10 pt}\\
    a^{\widetilde{(0)}\dagger}_{-k} \\
 \end{array} \right] = 
  \left[
\begin{array}{cc}
    \alpha_k &      \beta_k \\
    \beta_k        & \alpha_k \\
\end{array} \right]
\left[ \begin{array}{l}
    c^R_k \\
    c^{L\dagger}_{-k} \\
  \end{array} \right]
\label{diag}
\end{equation}
and three others, where the $a^{\widetilde{(0)}\dagger}_{-k}$ is a left wedge creation operator. We can summarize the transform in the right wedge $W$ as
\begin{equation}
  a_k^{(0)} = \alpha_k c_k^R + \beta_k c_{-k}^{L\dagger}
\label{a_in_c}
\end{equation}
and three other similar relations for $a_{-k}^{(0)}$, $a_{k}^{(0)\dagger}$, and $a_{-k}^{(0)\dagger}$.

We next compute the more general non-diagonal mixed Bogoliubov transformations.
\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{rll}
  (c \rightarrow M) : & a^{(c)}_k &= \int \dv{q} \alpha^{(c \rightarrow M)}_{kq} a^{M}_q + \beta^{(c \rightarrow M)}_{kq} a^{(M)\dagger}_q \\
  (c \rightarrow 0) : &   a^{(c)}_k &= \int \dv{q} \alpha^{(c \rightarrow 0)}_{kq} a^{(0)}_q + \beta^{(c \rightarrow 0)}_{kq} a^{(0)\dagger}_q \\
  (\widetilde{c} \rightarrow 0) : &   a^{(\tilde{c})}_k &= \int \dv{q} \alpha^{(\widetilde{c} \rightarrow 0)}_{kq} a^{(0)}_q + \beta^{(\widetilde{c} \rightarrow 0)}_{kq} a^{(0)\dagger}_q \\
  \end{array}
\end{equation}
We make use of a gamma function for $(c \rightarrow M)$. This occurs naturally in the KG dot product as an integral over an exponential phase from $\varphi_k$ and a $(x-c)$ power from $r_k^{(c)}$ (the Mellin transform of $e^{ikx}$ \cite{bracewell1966fourier}):
\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{ccl}
    \alpha^{(c \rightarrow M)}_{kq} &= \left<\varphi_q, r_k^{(c)} \right> &= \frac{1}{2 \pi a} \sqrt{\frac{\omega_k}{\omega_q}} \left(\frac{a}{q}\right)^{\frac{i\omega_k}{a}} e^{\frac{\pi \omega_k}{2a}} \Gamma\left(\frac{i\omega_k}{a}\right) \\
    \beta^{(c \rightarrow M)}_{kq} &= \left<\varphi_q^*, r_k^{(c)} \right> &= \frac{1}{2 \pi a} \sqrt{\frac{\omega_k}{\omega_q}} \left(\frac{a}{q}\right)^{\frac{i\omega_k}{a}} e^{\frac{-\pi \omega_k}{2a}} \Gamma\left(\frac{i\omega_k}{a}\right) \\
  \end{array}
  \label{bogoCM}
\end{equation}
Next we consider products of shifted powers to go after $(c \rightarrow 0)$. We make use of a beta function for $(c \rightarrow 0)$ which occurs naturally in the KG dot product as an integral over a power of $x$ and of $x-c$, from $r_k^{(0)}$ and $r_k^{(c)}$ respectively.  We compute the Bogoliubov coefficients as
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \alpha^{(c \rightarrow 0)}_{kq} &= \left<r_q^{(0)}, r_k^{(c)} \right> = \frac{1}{2 \pi a}\sqrt{\frac{\omega_k}{\omega_q}} (ac)^{\frac{i(\omega_k - \omega_q)}{a}} B\left(\frac{i\omega_k}{a}, \frac{-i(\omega_k - \omega_q)}{a}\right) \\
    \beta^{(c \rightarrow 0)}_{kq} &= \left<r_q^{(0)*}, r_k^{(c)} \right> = \frac{1}{2 \pi a}\sqrt{\frac{\omega_k}{\omega_q}} (ac)^{\frac{i(\omega_k + \omega_q)}{a}} B\left(\frac{i\omega_k}{a}, \frac{-i(\omega_k + \omega_q)}{a}\right) \\
  \end{aligned}
  \label{bogoC0}
\end{equation}
The reflected diamond wedge version also yields a beta function, but with a different form
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \alpha^{(\widetilde{c} \rightarrow 0)}_{kq}     &= \left<r_q^{(0)*}, r_k^{(\widetilde{c})} \right> = \frac{1}{2 \pi a}\frac{\sqrt{\omega_k \omega_q}}{\omega_q - \omega_k} (ac)^{\frac{i(\omega_k - \omega_q)}{a}} B\left(\frac{i\omega_k}{a}, -\frac{i\omega_q}{a}\right) \\
    \beta^{(\widetilde{c} \rightarrow 0)}_{kq} &= \left<r_q^{(0)}, r_k^{(\widetilde{c})} \right> = \frac{1}{2 \pi a}\frac{\sqrt{\omega_k \omega_q}}{\omega_q + \omega_k} (ac)^{\frac{i(\omega_k + \omega_q)}{a}} B\left(\frac{i\omega_k}{a}, \frac{i\omega_q}{a}\right) \\
  \end{aligned}
  \label{bogoTC0}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Modular Automorphisms} \label{sec:mod}

We can compare absolute magnitudes for $M$ v.s. $W_c$ and see that they don't depend on $c$
\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{cc}
    \left|\alpha_{kq}^{(c_1 \rightarrow M)}\right|^2 = \left|\alpha_{kq}^{(c_2 \rightarrow M)}\right|^2 & \\
    \left|\beta_{kq}^{(c_1 \rightarrow M)}\right|^2 = \left|\beta_{kq}^{(c_2 \rightarrow M)}\right|^2 & \\
 \end{array}
\end{equation}
The $c$ independence is expected in this case since Unruh radiation is translation invariant. We next turn to $(c \rightarrow 0)$ and also find $c$ independence there 
\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{c}
    \left|\alpha_{kq}^{(c_1 \rightarrow 0)}\right| = \left|\alpha_{kq}^{(c_2 \rightarrow 0)}\right| \vspace{4pt} \\
    \left|\beta_{kq}^{(c_1 \rightarrow 0)}\right| = \left|\beta_{kq}^{(c_2 \rightarrow 0)}\right| \\
  \end{array}
\end{equation}
This invariance is more surprising than in the Minkowski case, as it implies that the expected number of excitations for a mode $r_k^{(c_2)}$ when expressed in the vacuum of $W_{c_1}$,
\begin{equation}
  \int \dv{q} |\beta^{(c_2 \rightarrow c_1)}_{kq}|^2
\end{equation}
is invariant\footnote{Similar statements are true for reflected (diamond) wedges.} under changes in both $c_1$ and $c_2$.

More explicitly using the form of the $c$ term in equations (\ref{bogoC0}) and (\ref{bogoTC0}) we have a transform matrix of $\Lambda_c$ from $W_0$ to $W_c$ 
\begin{equation}
  \left[ \begin{array}{l}
    a^{(c)}_k \\
    a^{(c)}_{-k} \\
    \hline 
    a^{(c)\dagger}_k \\
    a^{(c)\dagger}_{-k} \\
 \end{array} \right] = \underbrace{
  \left[
\begin{array}{rr|rr}
    A_c        &       0   &  B_c            &  0 \\
    0        &      -A_c   &  0            & -B_c \\
    \hline 
    \overline{B_c}        &    0      &  \overline{A_c} & 0 \\
    0 &    -\overline{B_c}      &   0           & -\overline{A_c} \\
\end{array} \right]_{k,q} }_{\Lambda_c}
  \left[ \begin{array}{l}
    a^{(0)}_q \\
    a^{(0)}_{-q} \\
    \hline
    a^{(0)\dagger}_q \\
    a^{(0)\dagger}_{-q} \\
 \end{array} \right]
\end{equation}
where $A_c = \alpha_{kq}^{(c \rightarrow 0)} = P_c A_1 P_c^{-1}$  and $B_c = \beta_{kq}^{(c \rightarrow 0)} = P_c B_1 P_c$ for a diagonal phase factor matrix
\begin{equation}
  P_{c,rs} = \delta(r - s) c^{\frac{i\omega_r}{a}} = e^{\frac{i H}{a} \log c}
\end{equation}
where $H$ is the Rindler Hamiltonian associated with mode frequency $\omega_k$. We can write $\Lambda_c$ out compactly out as
\begin{equation}
  \Lambda_c = Q_c \Lambda_1 Q_c^{-1}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  Q_c = \left[\begin{array}{cccc}
        P_c, & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & P_c & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & P_c^{-1} & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & P_c^{-1} \\
    \end{array} \right] 
\end{equation}
The composition of Bogoliubov transforms, $\Lambda_{nc} = \Lambda_c^n$, yields
\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{ll}    
    Q_{nc} \Lambda_1 Q_{nc}^{-1}  &= \Lambda_{nc} \\
         &= \left(Q_c \Lambda_{c} Q_c\right) \left( Q_c^{-1} \Lambda_{c} Q_c\right) \cdots \left(Q_c \Lambda_{c} Q_c\right) \\
  &= Q_c \Lambda_c^n Q_c^{-1} \\
  \end{array}
\end{equation}
so that
\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{ll}
  \Lambda_c^n &= Q_c^{-1} Q_{nc} \Lambda_1 Q_{nc}^{-1} Q{c} \\
  &= Q_n \Lambda_1 Q_n^{-1}
  \end{array}
\end{equation}
and more generally we have a one parameter unitary group under the modular parameter $x = \log c$, with generator $H/a$ given by
\begin{equation}
  \left\{\Lambda_1^x = Q_x \Lambda_1 Q_x^{-1} : x \in \mathbb{R} \right\}.
\end{equation}
So these Bogoliubov transformations between shifted wedges form a one-parameter group under translations of the apex, exhibiting a symmetry that parallels modular automorphism flow in algebraic QFT \cite{borchers2000revolutionizing}. In contrast to traditional treatments emphasizing Lorentz boosts within a fixed wedge, this formulation reveals modular structure via spatially translated wedges.

Consider a sequence
\begin{equation}
  W_{c_n} \subseteq \cdots \subseteq W_{c_i} \subseteq \cdots \subseteq W_{c_j} \subseteq W_{c_2} \subseteq W_{c_1}
  \label{chain}
\end{equation}
The result is that each inclusion $W_{c_i} \subseteq W_{c_j}$ yields the same ``amount'' and ``type'' of particle production, with fixed squared Bogoliubov magnitude $|\beta_{kq}|^2$, implying that the expected number of particles remains constant across all nested wedge pairs, independent of the actual values of $c_i$ or $c_j$.  We will briefly revisit this chain in Section \ref{sec:chain_sources}.

\section{Driving Sources} \label{sec:drive}

We now turn to a foundational question: {\bf What, physically, is accelerating the observer?''} In standard Unruh-effect derivations, the acceleration is treated as given; here we supply a concrete mechanism in the form of a localized, entangled source, thereby shifting from the kinematic mathematics to a dynamical, source-based picture.

In Section \ref{sec:prelim} we introduced acceleration as a geometric feature, a coordinate choice, without reference to any underlying dynamical mechanism. Moreover, we have left unspecified both the observer’s precise location within the Rindler wedge and the spatial origin of the detected excitations. These omissions reflect an effective coarse-graining over the details of the observer and their interaction with the field, a feature that contributes to the apparent thermality observed in the Unruh effect.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{emit_absorb.png}
\captionsetup{width=0.7\textwidth}
\caption{A Rindler mode's frequency is smeared out in Minkowski space, blue-shifted near the horizon, and red-shifted as $x$ goes to positive infinity. We diagram a particle as if it were striking a mirror at the rear of a rocket, where its reflection emerges as a combination of emission and absorption processes in the Rindler frame.}
\label{emit_absorb}
\end{figure}

A natural physical interpretation is that a {\it driving source} must exist, both as the cause of the observer’s acceleration, and as a localized source coupled to the quantum field. In this view, acceleration is not merely a kinematic artifact or coordinate reparameterization, but the result of active, localized interactions along the observer’s worldline. These interactions are responsible for the observer’s motion.  This plays well with the notion that the observer is not in an isotropic background radiation, but is actually thrusted away from a thermal event horizon, the thrust being intimately correlated with the causal horizon.


Figure \ref{emit_absorb} illustrates the situation with a particle composed of Rindler modes on the right wedge. The modes $r_k$ are left-moving, propagating toward the future horizon and associated with {\it emission}; the $r_{-k}$ modes are right-moving, originating from the past horizon and are associated with {\it absorption}. These Rindler modes are constructed as superpositions of restricted Minkowski modes ${\varphi_q}_{|_W}$ effectively smeared across a range of frequencies.  This frequency mixing is evident in Figure \ref{unruh_rainbow}, where the modes blue-shift infinitely near the horizons and red-shift infinitely at spatial infinity, reflecting the geometry of the wedge.

\subsection{Construction}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{paz.png}
\captionsetup{width=0.7\textwidth}
\caption{A thruster in the past, Paz(P), emits an entangled photon pair that accelerates Wright(R) (to the right) and Lester(L) (to the left).}
\label{paz}
\end{figure}


We begin our construction of a driving source by following an Alice-and-Bob style naming convention, we use the names Wright (R), Lester (L), and Paz (P) to represent observers at $(t,x)$ = $(0,1)$, $(0,-1)$, and $(-1,0)$, respectively. These names are chosen to evoke Right, Left, and Past, providing a mnemonic for their positions in spacetime. Paz serves as a common causal ancestor to Wright and Lester, and she emits an entangled pair of photons with momentum $\pm k$ and (Rindler) frequency $\omega = \omega_{\pm k}$ as part of a stream of photons that are in our model the source, and cause, of the acceleration of Wright and of Lester.  The accelerations are thus correlated.

Because the emitted photons carry perfectly balanced momenta, our basic model exhibits no back reaction -- this is a simplification -- in more general models, single-particle sources would encode back reaction through their entanglement structure, see Section \ref{sec:drive_phy} and Figure \ref{back_react}.

Now where we usually would create a localized detector for Wright, such as an Unruh-DeWitt detector \cite{unruh1976notes} \cite{einstein1979general} or a moving mirror\cite{fulling1976radiation} interacting with the field, we instead seek to model the situation where Paz, a {\it thruster}, is coupled to the field in the past. This inversion of effect and cause, of detector and thruster, is at the heart of our construction; we deliberately invert the usual order, instead of positing acceleration and deriving entanglement, we posit an entangled source and derive acceleration. 

Paz's emission makes the source of the acceleration manifest as particle injection, so that Wright will make sense of a {\it guaranteed} observation of a ``thrust particle'' with fixed peaked right moving momentum $-k$. Wright’s detection is entangled with Lester’s, and Lester will also observe a particle with left moving momentum $k$; measurement induced correlation.  

Physically, Paz introduces a bilocal source 
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    J(x,y) &= \lambda f_L(x)f_R(y)\\
    \mathscr{L}_{sourced} & = \mathscr{L}_{free} + \frac{1}{2}\lambda \int f_L(x)f_R(y) \phi_+(x) \phi_+(y)  + h.c.\\
                        &= \mathscr{L}_{free} + \frac{1}{2}\lambda \left(q_{k}^{L\dagger} q_{-k}^{R\dagger} + q_{k}^{L} q_{-k}^{R} \right)
 \end{aligned}
 \label{bilocal}
\end{equation}
with coupling constant $\lambda$, normalized mode profiles $f_L$ and $f_R$ supported on the left and right wedges respectively, creation operators $q_{k}^{L\dagger}$ and $q_{-k}^{R\dagger}$, and $\phi_+$ as the positive frequency (annihilator) part of $\phi$. The last part of equation (\ref{bilocal}) is the squeezing interaction for frequency $\omega$, so that the bilocal source creates entangled particles in the Rindler basis within the wedges.

This source construction is a quadratic generalization of the usual linear source term \cite{Schwinger_1966} \cite{ryder1996quantum} and is motivated by quadrature squeezed light generation in quantum optics \cite{gerry2023introductory}; it is a coupling of a classical function $J$ with the field as an interaction term smeared over $x$ and $y$. In this version $J$ squeezes the field creating correlations that manifest as entanglement at the level of a global quantum state. The product structure reflects this paired excitation.

We consider the case where $f_L$ and $f_R$ are absorptions, or made up of left moving and right moving Minkowkski modes respectively; the emission case is similar see Section {\ref{sec:back_in_time}. In this picture, the bilocal source is not just a mathematical device but the physical mechanism by which acceleration is generated: the entangled pair created by $J(x,y)$ supplies the correlated excitations that are experienced as thrust by the Rindler observers.


Smearing with $\phi_+$ projects $f_L$ and $f_R$ onto their positive frequency parts which we call $g_L$ and $g_R$ respectively. In particular we can choose $f_L$ and $f_R$ to be Rindler modes $l_k$ and $r_{-k}$ in which case the projection is onto the corresponding Unruh modes $\mu_k$ and $\mu_{-k}$, so that $q_{k}^{L\dagger}$ and $q_{-k}^{R\dagger}$ are the corresponding Unruh operators $c_{k}^{L\dagger}$ and $c_{-k}^{R\dagger}$\footnote{See Section \ref{sec:prelim} equations (\ref{rindler_mode_def}), (\ref{unruh_mode_def}), and (\ref{c_ladder}).}.

We next consider the standard thermal vacuum description\footnote{The form of this vacuum equation can be proven by recursively applying the Bogoliubov relations from equation (\ref{a_in_c}).} of the Unruh effect
\begin{equation}
  \ket{0}_M = \prod_{\omega} \frac{1}{\cosh{\theta_k}} \sum_n \tanh^n{\theta_k} \ket{n_\omega}_{L} \ket{n_\omega}_{R}.
  \label{vacuum}
\end{equation}
A state that factorizes into correlated excitations in the left (L) and right (R) wedges. The Unruh modes associated with frequency $\omega$ are specific linear combination of these $L$ and $R$ Rindler modes, so that any source $J$ coupling to it will, in general, drive correlated excitations across both wedges. For example, the state prepared by Paz with Rindler modes corresponds to a selective excitation at a fixed $\omega$,
\begin{equation}
  \ket{\Psi_\omega}_M = \ket{1_\omega}_L \ket{1_\omega}_R + \text{O(higher terms)},
  \label{one_fock}
\end{equation}
a controlled realization of one term in the ensemble coming from the Rindler/Unruh modes. Our source projects the state onto the $\omega$ term through the act of observation, i.e. by a PVM projection in the standard quantum-measurement sense, so that Wright’s guaranteed detection is modeled as the measurement-induced selection of a specific component of the thermal ensemble. The source $J(x,y)$ does not contradict the thermal interpretation, but rather describes a specific ``microstate'' consistent with the broader thermal ensemble.

An illustration of this setup is shown in Figure \ref{rocket_inertial}. From this perspective, the apparent thermality arises from intrinsic properties of the vacuum, an effective ignorance of the source's detailed structure and dynamics. In the sourced view, the Unruh effect is not a passive revelation of hidden particles in the vacuum, but a measurable consequence of {\it thrust}.

\subsection{Physical Details} \label{sec:drive_phy}

The construction of a right moving absorption function $f_R$ for Wright presents some physical challenges.

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Mode Projection}. We note that the $f_L$ and $f_R$ that match equation (\ref{one_fock}) are exactly the Rindler modes $l_k$ and $r_{-k}$ from Section \ref{sec:prelim}. The source $J$ is described in the Rindler wedges, and not immediately on the past wedge, so Paz will need to couple to Unruh modes -- the analytically continued Rindler modes.  We form $f_R$ out of a linear combination of a left Unruh mode $\mu^{L*}_{k}$ and right Unruh mode $\mu^R_{-k}$ to get $r_{-k}$ supported on just the right wedge, see equation (\ref{unruh_mode_def}).  The projection in equation (\ref{bilocal}) encodes this relation by projecting the Rindler modes onto Unruh modes or in more generality by projecting $f_L$ and $f_R$ onto positive frequency $g_L$ and $g_R$.

\item{\bf Source over Finite Time}. We are integrating over the entire Minkowski space instead of over a short time period as normally desired for a source $J$.  This challenge is met by noticing that the projected positive frequency modes $g_L$ and $g_R$ can be restricted and scaled on a small time interval $|t + 1| < \delta$ around Paz's time $t=-1$ to give the same result, see Figure \ref{paz_freq} (right picture). This is because the integral over $x$ is independant of $t$. This is manifestly evident by the fact that the mode is translation invariant over time and space, $g_R(t,x) = g_R(-1,x+t+1)$, since it is a sum of right moving Minkowski modes. The coupling constant $\lambda$ in equation (\ref{bilocal}), along with $\delta$, can be chosen to match the vacuum equation (\ref{vacuum}) at $n_\omega = 1$.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{paz_freq.png}
\hspace{20 pt}
\includegraphics[scale=0.235]{paz_bw.png}
\captionsetup{width=0.7\textwidth}
\caption{The points marked with black and white dots at (0,1) (Wright) and (-1,0) (Paz) respectively in the left picture lie on the same Unruh mode trajectory; although the mode is infinitely blue-shifted at the horizon, it settles down at Wright and Paz's locations. The right figure illustrates a finite time interval of width $\delta$ for the source $J$ to be active. Note how each time slice is a translation of the time = -1 slice.}
\label{paz_freq}
\end{figure}


\item {\bf Blue Shifting near Horizon}. A third note is that the Unruh modes undergo an infinite blue shift at the horizon, but are more well behaved at Wright and Paz's locations. $f_R$ is actually zero at Paz and in fact on the entire past wedge, but the projection is to an Unruh mode which is nonzero at Paz's location. We study the localization of functions on the right wedge in subsequent sections where we aim to attenuate or bound $f_R$ away from the high-frequency, near-horizon behavior typical of thermal modes, making the physical realization of the source $J$ more plausible as a wave packet.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{back_reaction.png}
\captionsetup{width=0.7\textwidth}
\caption{Paz emits a single photon and experiences a back reaction pushing her toward the left wedge. Through recoil she becomes entangled with the emitted particle, effectively taking on the role that Lester played in the symmetric construction.}
\label{back_react}
\end{figure}

\item {\bf Single Photon Models}. We mention that our running example represents just one of many possible mechanisms for exchanging energy and correlations between wedges; for example, in our symmetric two–mode setup, the momenta are balanced and the source does not experience recoil, so there is no back reaction. By contrast, if Paz emitted a single particle, as in Figure \ref{back_react}, the emitted mode would necessarily be entangled with Paz’s internal state and/or recoil momentum, producing back reaction as field–source entanglement. Tracing out the source would leave Wright with a mixed state, and the apparent thermality would then arise from this entanglement with the thruster’s degrees of freedom. Our choice of a balanced bilocal source thus isolates the thrust mechanism while postponing the additional complication of explicit source recoil for future research.

\item {\bf Emission} We could also study the emission case (we have been studying the absorption case); where $f_L$ and $f_R$ are made up of right moving and left moving Minkowski modes respectively.  These would posit a common observer in the future. The moving mirror exemplifies aspects of both the ``Emission'' and ``Single Photon Model'' cases. These cases involve additional complications beyond the scope of our note and are a topic of future research.
\end{itemize}

For the remainder of this note, we focus on the function $f_R$ in the right wedge without explicit reference to $f_L$, operating under the assumption that the localized driving source in the right wedge arises from a globally entangled paired source.

\subsection{Back in Time Story} \label{sec:back_in_time}
The following discussion should be read as a heuristic narrative rather than a literal dynamical account; it illustrates how the time orientation of Rindler wedges lends itself to a “back in time” story that mirrors the entanglement structure.  Wright's proper time (Right Rindler time) is by convention set up to be in the direction of Minkowski time. By contrast, Lester's proper time (Left Rindler time) in the left wedge is flowing in reverse to Minkowski time.  So we can actually track the story as:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Lester ``emits'' a particle traveling back in time.
\item Paz receives this particle and reflects it forward in time to Wright.
\item Wright then absorbs the particle.
\end{enumerate}
The presence of virtual particle-antiparticle pairs in massive scalar fields further enriches this picture, where antiparticles are understood as particles moving ``back in time'', though this extension lies beyond the scope of this present note.

We can interchange these emission and absorption stories, Wright emits and Lester absorbs, but we would need to involve an observer in the future say at $(t,x) = (1,0)$ for that.  

\subsection{Sub-Wedge Causal Chain} \label{sec:chain_sources}

The sub-wedge sequence mentioned in equation (\ref{chain}) has an interesting interpretation.  The vacuums are entangled from each wedge to the next sub-wedge, and each subwedge has vacuum particle expectations of the same ``amount'' and ``type''. In our construction, this is understood as a causal chain from Paz to Wright.  Each sub-wedge inherits a source $J$ and $f_R$ from the previous. 

\section{Localization} \label{sec:loc}

Up to now, our modes have been perfectly sharp in Rindler frequency. We now construct various localization techniques. From here on we often interchange ``Rindler'' and ``Unruh'' modes when referring to their restriction to a single wedge, since our focus is on the localized support.

\subsection{Localization via Translated Wedge Inclusion}

Consider the two nested Rindler wedges $W_c \subseteq W_0$ shown in Figure \ref{restrict}. Let $r_q$ denote a Rindler mode associated with $W_0$, analytically continued to the entire Minkowski space. The gray-scale region indicates the full support of $r_q$, while the rainbow-colored segment shows its restriction to the sub-wedge $W_c$.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{wedge_in_wedge.png}
\caption{A Wedge $W_c$ (cyan) inside of the wedge $W_0$ (white). Rindler mode $r_q$ of $W_0$ (gray-scale) restricted to $W_c$ (rainbow).}
\label{restrict}
\end{figure}

By considering the restriction of $r_q$ to $W_c$, we have partially localized the observer and the mode. The restriction effectively cuts off the high-frequency content of $r_q$ near the future horizon\footnote{Similarly, $r_{-q}$ experiences suppression near the past horizon.} of $W_0$. The resulting mode still spans the full spatial extent of $W_c$, but it is now insulated from the highly oscillatory behavior near the horizons of $W_0$.  The localization is not complete however, the observer can still be anywhere within the wedge $W_c$, and the corresponding modes $r_k$ still exhibit thermal characteristics because of low-frequency oscillations extending throughout the wedge.

To further study the situation, consider the modulus squared inner product $\left|\left<r_q^{(0)}, r_k^{(c)} \right>\right|^2$, also known as the Bogoliubov $\left|\alpha^{(c \rightarrow 0)}_{kq}\right|^2$, from equation (\ref{bogoC0}).  We fix $q$ and use $|\Gamma(ib)|^2 = \frac{\pi}{b \sinh \pi b}$ to obtain
\begin{equation}
  \left|\left<r_q^{(0)}, r_k^{(c)} \right>\right|^2 = \frac{\sinh \frac{\pi \omega_q}{a}}{4\pi a (\omega_q - \omega_k) \sinh \pi \frac{\omega_q - \omega_k}{a} \sinh \frac{\pi \omega_k}{a}}
\end{equation}
as a function of $\omega_k$. The function exhibits a second-order pole at $\omega_k = \omega_q$, resulting in a sharply peaked feature, see Figure $\ref{peaked}$. Although the $\sinh$ terms encode aspects of the familiar thermal distribution, especially broadening near $\omega_k = 0$, the existence of the peak itself at $\omega_k = \omega_q$ originates from the geometric restriction, not from a detector’s passive response to the vacuum, but as the active spectral footprint of a localized source.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{peaked.png}
\caption{The Rindler modes $r_k$ of $W_c$ show a peaked spectral overlap with $r_q$ at $\omega_k = \omega_q$. The incomplete beta function strengthens the spectral peak and suppresses the peak at zero.}
\label{peaked}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Diamond Localization via Reflected Wedge Intersection}

Further localization is achieved by intersecting $W_c$ with a reflected wedge $\widetilde{W}_{2c}$. This defines a more tightly localized diamond-shaped region, as shown in Figure \ref{diamond}. The mode $r_q$ is now restricted to the intersection $W_c \cap \widetilde{W}_{2c}$, which eliminates much of the infrared behavior previously associated with the unrestricted wedge.

The Klein Gordon inner product at $t=0$ now takes the form of an incomplete version of the beta function from equation (\ref{bogoC0}), corresponding to an integral\footnote{We could also use the other form of the beta function in equation (\ref{bogoTC0}) to compute the same inner product.} evaluated from $c$ to $2c$ rather than extending to infinity. This inner product does not however correspond to a mode expansion of the field, since we restrict the support to the diamond. So the construction does not define a complete orthonormal set, and cannot be used to build a full basis of field modes on the entire wedge.

This motivates a shift in perspective: rather than interpreting $r_q$ as part of a global mode expansion, we regard it as a compactly supported, non-invariant test function, i.e., a driving source localized to the diamond region, consistent with the source framework introduced in Section \ref{sec:drive}. We turn on $r_q$ exactly for a fixed period of $x-t$ (or $x+t$ for $r_{-q}$). The resulting spectral response in the diamond, computed from this truncated integral, is shown\footnote{The complete (red) beta function curve is actually independent of the choice of translation $c$, it is the same curve for any sub-wedge space-like inclusion (see modular automorphism Section \ref{sec:mod}). In contrast, the incomplete beta function curve (blue) does depend on the endpoint ($2c$ is shown).} in Figure \ref{peaked}.


The plot reveals that the main spectral peak at $\omega_k = \omega_q$ persists, while the thermal contribution near $\omega = 0$ is significantly attenuated.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{diamond_in_wedge.png}
\caption{The same situation as in Figure \ref{restrict} but we further intersect with a reflected (left) wedge $\widetilde{W}_{2c}$ (green). Rindler mode $r_q$ of $W_0$ (gray-scale) restricted to $W_c \cap \widetilde{W}_{2c}$ (rainbow).}
\label{diamond}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Thermal to Localized Interpolation}
To further probe how global thermal structure transitions into a localized excitation, we consider the behavior of Rindler-to-Minkowski Bogoliubov coefficients when weighted by a Gaussian envelope. This allows us to interpolate between de-localized (thermal) and localized (spectrally peaked) behavior. We use parabolic cylinder functions \cite{AbramowitzStegun1964,Olver1959UniformAE} which are the analytic continuation of 

\begin{equation}
D_\nu(-z) = \frac{e^{-\frac{1}{4}z^2}}{\Gamma\left(-\nu\right)} \int_0^\infty  \dv{s} e^{zs} s^{-\nu - 1} e^{-\frac{1}{2} s^2}, \mathfrak{R}\nu < 0,
\end{equation}
where we use $-z$ instead of the usual $z$ so that future equations become simpler.


Without loss of generality, let $N_{\mu, \sigma} = e^{-\frac{1}{2} \frac{(x-t-\mu)^2}{\sigma^2}}$ be a (left-moving) Gaussian kernel with fixed $\mu$. We will multiply $\varphi_q^*$ by $N_{\mu, \sigma}$, but we could just as easily multiply $r_k$ by $N_{\mu, \sigma}$ for the same effect. A key aspect of this construction is that the resulting Minkowski modes are treated as driving sources rather than elements of an orthonormal mode expansion. Since we are not working within an orthonormal mode expansion, the normalization of $N_{\mu, \sigma}$ is left implicit. For clarity, since this setup may be non-standard, we carry out the calculations explicitly in this section.  We will examine the $N_{\mu,\sigma}$ modification of $\beta^{(c \rightarrow M)}_{kq}$ in  equation (\ref{bogoCM})

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \left< \varphi_q^* N_{\mu,\sigma}, r_k\right> &= \frac{1}{4\pi \sqrt{\omega_q \omega_k}} 2i \int_{\Sigma_W} e^{-i(\omega_q t - q x)} e^{-\frac{1}{2} \frac{(x-t-\mu)^2}{\sigma^2}} \partial_t (a(x-t))^\frac{i\omega_k}{a} \\
    &= \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{\omega_k}{\omega_q}} a^{\frac{i \omega_k}{a} - 1} \int_0^\infty  \dv{x} e^{-\frac{1}{2} \frac{(x-\mu)^2}{\sigma^2} + i q x} x^{\frac{i\omega_k}{a} - 1} \\
    &= \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{\omega_k}{\omega_q}} a^{\frac{i \omega_k}{a} - 1} \int_0^\infty \dv{x} e^{\left(-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\right) x^2 + \left(\frac{\mu}{\sigma^2} + i q \right) x + \left( -\frac{\mu^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)} x^{\frac{i\omega_k}{a} - 1}  \\
    &= \frac{1}{2\pi a} \sqrt{\frac{\omega_k}{\omega_q}} e^{-\frac{\mu^2}{2 \sigma^2}} \sigma^{\frac{i\omega_k}{a}} a^{\frac{i \omega_k}{a} }  \int_0^\infty \dv{s} e^{(\frac{\mu}{\sigma} + i q \sigma)s} s^{\frac{i\omega_k}{a} - 1} e^{-\frac{1}{2} s^2} \\
    &= \frac{1}{2\pi a} \sqrt{\frac{\omega_k}{\omega_q}} e^{-\frac{\mu^2}{2 \sigma^2}} {(\sigma a)}^{\frac{i \omega_k}{a}} e^{\frac{1}{4}(i q \sigma + \frac{\mu}{\sigma})^2} \Gamma\left(\frac{i\omega_k}{a}\right) D_{-\frac{i\omega_k}{a}}(-i q\sigma - \frac{\mu}{\sigma}) \\
    &=  \frac{1}{2\pi a } \sqrt{\frac{\omega_k}{\omega_q}} e^{-\frac{\mu^2}{2 \sigma^2}}  (\sigma a)^\frac{i\omega_k}{a} e^{\frac{1}{4} z^2} \Gamma(-\nu) D_\nu(-z)
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\Sigma_W$ is the Cauchy surface $\eta=0$ on the Rindler wedge $W$,  $x = \sigma s$, $z = i q \sigma + \frac{\mu}{\sigma}$, and $\nu = -\frac{i \omega_k}{a}$. And then
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \left|\left< \varphi^*_q N_{\mu,\sigma}, r_k \right>\right|^2 &= \frac{1}{2\pi a \omega_q} \frac{\omega_k}{2\pi a} e^{-\frac{\mu^2}{\sigma^2}} \left| e^{\frac{1}{2} z^2} \right| \left| \Gamma(-\nu) \right|^2 \left| D_\nu(-z) \right|^2 \\
  \end{aligned}
\label{pcf}
\end{equation}
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{stokes.png}
\caption{Trajectory of $z = i q \sigma + \frac{\mu}{\sigma}$ as $\sigma$ interpolates between thermal and localized regimes.

See also corresponding Figure \ref{pcf_sigma_curves}.}
\label{stokes}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}

\label{pcf_sigma_curves}
\end{figure}
From \cite{Olver1959UniformAE} we have
\begin{equation}
  D_\nu(-z) = e^{-i\pi\nu}z^{\nu}e^{-\frac{1}{4}z^2} \{ 1 + O(|z|^{-2}) \} + \frac{(2 \pi)^{\frac{1}{2}}}{\Gamma(-\nu)} z^{-\nu - 1} e^{\frac{1}{4}z^2} \{1 + O(|z|^{-2})\}
\label{asym}
\end{equation}
when $-\frac{1}{4}\pi + \epsilon \le \arg z \le \frac{3}{4} \pi - \epsilon$.

The two asymptotic regimes correspond to physically distinct interpretations: The second $e^{\frac{1}{4}z^2}$ term dominates for $z \to \infty$ as $\sigma \to 0$ and the first  $e^{-\frac{1}{4}z^2}$ term dominates for $z \to i \infty$ as $\sigma \to \infty$.  This is a Stokes phenomenon\footnote{See \cite{hashiba2021stokes} for a similar situation where the Stokes phenomenon is applied to particle production in simple expanding backgrounds, preheating after $R^2$ inflation, and a transition model with smoothly changing mass.} which flips over as we cross the Stokes line at $\arg z = \frac{\pi}{4}$. The situation is pictured in Figure \ref{stokes}.


We next combine equations (\ref{pcf}) and (\ref{asym}).  First for the thermal part that comes from the $e^{-\frac{1}{4}z^2}$ term where $\sigma \to \infty$ we have
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    2\pi a \omega_q \left|\left< \varphi^*_q N, r_k \right>\right|^2 &= \frac{\omega_k}{2 \pi a} e^{-\frac{\mu^2}{\sigma^2}} \left|e^{-i\pi \nu} z^\nu\Gamma\left(\frac{i\omega_k}{a}\right)\right|^2   \\
    &= \frac{\omega_k}{2 \pi a} e^{-\frac{\mu^2}{\sigma^2}}  e^{\frac{-2\pi \omega_k}{a}} \left|e^{\frac{-2i\omega_k}{a} \log{(\frac{\mu}{\sigma} + iq\sigma)}}\right|^2  \frac{\pi}{\frac{\omega_k}{a} \sinh \frac{\pi \omega_k}{a}} \\
  &\to  e^{\frac{-2\pi \omega_k}{a}} \left|e^{\frac{-2i\omega_k}{a} \log{i}}\right|^2  \frac{1}{2\sinh \frac{\pi \omega_k}{a}} \\
  & =  e^{\frac{-2\pi \omega_k}{a}} e^{\frac{\pi \omega_k}{a}}  \frac{1}{ \left( e^{\frac{\pi \omega_k}{a}} - e^{\frac{-\pi \omega_k}{a}} \right)} \\
  & =  \frac{1}{e^{\frac{2\pi\omega_k}{a}} - 1} \\
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
which we expect by construction. For the localized part that comes from the $e^{\frac{1}{4}z^2}$ term where $\sigma \to 0$ we have
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    2\pi a \omega_q \left|\left< \varphi^*_q N, r_k \right>\right|^2 &= \frac{\omega_k}{a} e^{-\frac{\mu^2}{\sigma^2}} \left|e^{z^2}z ^ {2(-\nu - 1)}\right| \\
    &= \frac{\omega_k}{a} e^{-\frac{\mu^2}{\sigma^2}} \left|e^{ \left(  iq\sigma + \frac{\mu}{\sigma} \right)^2 } e^{{2\left(\frac{i\omega_k}{a} - 1\right)\log{ \left(  iq\sigma + \frac{\mu}{\sigma} \right)   }   }   }\right| \\
    &\to \frac{\omega_k}{a} e^{\frac{-2\epsilon\omega_k}{a}} f(\sigma,\mu) \\
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where the thermal pole at zero has disappeared. While the precise asymptotic form is not critical, we can control the ultraviolet behavior by taking $z$ to $(1+i\epsilon)\infty$ which remains within in the localized Stokes region. This introduces a regulating factor of the form $e^{-2\epsilon \omega_k / a}$, which suppresses high-frequency contributions. 

We should stop short of $\sigma$ actually reaching zero, since that is a localization to an extreme, where $N_{\mu,\sigma}$ shrinks to a bump with infinitesimal width; this is not a delta function, it is a vanishing source. We focus on the small-but-nonzero $\sigma$ regime where the thermal character has already disappeared. See Figure \ref{pcf_sigma_curves} for representative plots across varying values of $\sigma$.

\section{Future Research} \label{sec:future}

Several directions naturally extend the present work:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Moving Mirrors}. While a moving mirror can be interpreted as a type of ``thruster'', as in Section \ref{sec:drive}, that reshapes the field through boundary acceleration, here we isolated the thruster from the detector role. Incorporating moving mirror timeline localizations into this framework remains an open task.

\item {\bf Mode Pairing}. The construction of $f_L$ in Section \ref{sec:drive} was left aside in our treatments in Section \ref{sec:loc}. A more systematic analysis of the pairing between $f_L$ and $f_R$ would allow us to track correlations in greater generality.

\item {\bf Alternative Driving Source Models}. Beyond entangled emission, one may consider models involving single-photon sources or even time-reversed scenarios (see Section \ref{sec:drive_phy}), which could offer finer control over the entanglement structure.

\item {\bf Massive Fields}. Extending the analysis to massive scalar fields would open the possibility of studying localized virtual particle–antiparticle pair production, complementing the massless case.

\item {\bf Curved Spacetimes}. While our analysis is grounded in flat spacetime, the equivalence principle offers a natural pathway to curved geometries. In particular, applications to Hawking radiation could be explored by modeling localized excitations near black hole horizons. Figure \ref{rocket} illustrates this direction, highlighting a shift from thermal emission to localized, physically sourced excitations in the near-horizon region.

\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conc}

We have presented a framework connecting the Unruh effect to localized field excitations. Using a bilocal source and wedge-restricted Rindler/Unruh modes, we realize individual microstates of the thermal ensemble as physically localized, source-driven excitations, making the role of acceleration explicit rather than purely kinematic. We then construct compact wave-packets via parabolic cylinder functions, providing a smooth interpolation between global Rindler modes and localized spectral structures.

Our construction complements the standard detector-based interpretation by showing how apparent thermality can coexist with microstate-level localization. The framework also opens several directions for further investigation, including systematic mode pairing, moving mirror analogues, generalizations to massive fields, and potential extensions to curved spacetime geometries, with applications to near-horizon excitations in black hole physics.
